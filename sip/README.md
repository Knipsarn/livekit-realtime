# SIP Configuration

This directory contains SIP-related configuration files for PSTN integration with Telnyx.

## Purpose

The dispatch rule connects your Telnyx phone number to the AI agent. When someone calls your number, it creates a LiveKit room with "call-" prefix and automatically spawns the pstn-agent to handle the conversation.
